What is an interpreter in Python?\n","\n","Ans- An interpreter is a program that executes Python code line by line. Instead of compiling the whole program first, Python's interpreter checks the code line by line.\n","\n","3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n","\n","Ans-- Pre-defined keywords are reserved words in Python that have special meaning and purpose.\n","Examples: if, else, for, while, class, def, import, True, False, etc.\n","\n","4.Can keywords be used as variable names?\n","\n","Ans-- No, Keywords cannot be used as variable names because they are reserved word used for specific purposes in Python.\n","\n","5. What is mutability in Python?\n","\n","Ans-- Mutability means the content of an object can be changed after creation.\n","\n","Mutable objects can be changed\n","e.g., lists, dictionaries, sets.\n","\n","Immutable objects cannot be changed e.g., tuples, strings, integers.\n","\n","\n","6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n","\n","Ans-- Lists: Designed for which we can add the data after creation so that elements can be added, removed, or modified.\n","\n","Tuples: Designed for fixed data → once created, values cannot be changed, which makes them faster and memory-efficient.\n","\n","7. What is the difference between == and is operators in Python?\n","\n","Ans-- == operator checks values (content equality).\n","\n","is operator checks identity (whether two objects refer to the same memory location).\n","\n","8. What are logical operators in Python?\n","\n","Ans-- Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements:\n","\n","and : True if both conditions are true.\n","\n","or : True if at least one condition is true.\n","\n","not : Reverses the condition.\n","\n","9. What is type casting in Python?\n","\n","Ans-- Type casting is converting a variable from one data type to another data type.\n","\n","10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n","\n","Ans-- Implicit casting: Done automatically by Python.\n","Example: 3 + 4.5 → 7.5.\n","\n","Explicit casting: Done manually using functions like int(), float(), str().\n","\n","\n","11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n","\n","Ans-- Conditional statements allow decision-making in code. They execute different blocks of code depending on whether a condition is True or False.\n","\n","12. How does the elif statement work?\n","\n","elif means else if.\n","Ans-- If we have more than two condition then we use elif statement.\n","\n","13. What is the difference between for and while loops?\n","\n","Ans-- for loop is used when the number of iterations is known or finite.\n","\n","while loop is used when we know the condition.\n","\n","14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.\n","\n","Ans-- it will be better suitable when we know the condtion where the loop will end.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"obshvMiDm0MG"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Practical Question"],"metadata":{"id":"cVjIWJzFr7Di"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["1.
